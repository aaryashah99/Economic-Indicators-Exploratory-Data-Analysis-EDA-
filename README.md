#FED Rate Analysis 2024

This project aims to analyze key economic variables using exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques to understand the relationships between interest rates, GDP growth, inflation, unemployment, retail sales, and market trends. The analysis includes descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and trend identification over time.

Key components of this project:

Descriptive Statistics for Key Economic Variables - Summary statistics (mean, minimum, maximum, standard deviation) for quarterly interest rates and GDP growth, offering a foundational understanding of these variables' distributions over time.

Exploring Relationships Between Economic Indicators - Interest Rates & Inflation: A correlation analysis to determine how changes in interest rates impact inflation over various quarters.
Interest Rates & Unemployment: Examines the correlation between interest rates and unemployment rates to identify possible inverse or direct relationships.

Analyzing Market Trends and Reactions - Investigates how interest rates correlate with stock market performance (using the S&P 500 index), helping to understand how market movements react to changes in monetary policy.

Retail Sales Trends and Interest Rate Impact - Examines the impact of interest rate hikes on retail sales trends, identifying how consumer spending patterns change over time in relation to monetary policy.

Predicting GDP Growth Using Economic Indicators - Analyzes how interest rates, retail sales, and other economic factors correlate with GDP growth, using statistical methods to predict future trends.

Market Reaction to Interest Rate Changes - Identifies patterns in the market's reaction to interest rate changes, assessing how retail sales and GDP growth adjust based on policy decisions.

This analysis uses SQL queries to extract and process data from economic datasets, providing insights into the behavior of these indicators and their interrelationships. The goal is to inform decision-making in economic forecasting, investment strategies, and public policy.
